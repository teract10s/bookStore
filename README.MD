# **üìöOnline Book Store Project**

Welcome to the Online Book Store project! This project is a Java-based web application built using Spring Boot,
Hibernate, Liquibase, and other technologies to create a robust online bookstore.

## **üìù1. Introduction**

This project is an online bookstore that provides a platform for users to browse and purchase books. 
It is built using Java with a Spring Boot infrastructure, using technologies such as Hibernate for 
database interaction, Liquibase for database versioning, Swagger for API documentation, and JWT for 
secure user authentication. There can also be 2 types of users, USER and ADMIN. Accordingly, the 
USER can create an order, place a shopping cart, view existing resources, and his history. At that 
time, ADIMIN can do everything that USER can, as well as change USER's order status, update and 
delete resources.
## **üíª2. Technologies Used**

* Java 17
* Spring v3.1.4 (Boot, Web, JPA, Security)
* Hibernate
* Liquibase v4.20.0
* Docker 3.8
* AWS
* JUnit 5
* Mockito
* Swagger

## **ü™™5. Security**

### Overview
The security module in this project relies on JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication and authorization. JWT is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. In this context, it is used to securely manage user sessions and authorize access to protected resources.
